# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
   It is the design, implementation, and maintenance of complex computer programs

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

  software engineering takes a holistic approach, considering both technical and non-technical aspects, while traditional programming focuses primarily on writing code. Both play crucial roles in creating software, but software engineering aims for robustness, scalability, and long-term success

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
  SDLC entails the entire software development process, including planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

   1. defining requirements- this is done so as to know the user needs and system requirements.
   2. design- creation of high level and detailed designs.
   3. implementation- writing of the code.
   4. testing- to verify software quality and functionality.
   5. deployment- this is to release the software to production.
   6. maintenance- this is to support and enhance the software post-release

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

   - agile works in rapid iteration, autonomy, and flexibility while waterfall works in  Linear, well-defined stages with formal hand-offs.
   - agile is suitable for projects with evolving requirements while waterfall is for Large, complex projects with stable requirements

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
   RE involves identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.

   Requirements engineering involves:Feasibility Study,Requirements Elicitation,Requirements Specification,Verification & Validation and Requirements Management

   It ensures that the software aligns with user requirements and business goals.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
    Modularity in software design refers to breaking down a complex system into smaller, independent modules. These modules perform specific functions and interact through well-defined interfaces

     modularity enhances software maintainability, scalability, and development efficiency by promoting separation of concerns and independent functionality.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
     - Unit testing- this the testing of individual software units whereby  Each component is tested in isolation from the rest of the system.
     -integration testing- this  focuses on interactions between components or systems.
     -system testing- this  evaluates both functional and non-functional requirements and ensures compliance with specified needs.
     -acceptance testing- this  Validates if the software meets user requirements and determines if the software is ready for deployment.

     testing is essential for delivering reliable, user-friendly software that meets expectations and avoids costly pitfalls
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
    - Version control systems are systems that manage changes to source code and they keep a detailed record of every modification made to the code, making changes trackable and reversible.
    EXAMPLES
    Git- it is standard due to speed, flexibility, and robust features.
    Subversion (SVN)- it has a Centralized system with strong branching capabilities.
    Mercurial- Has a Distributed system with a focus on simplicity and ease of use
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
    In software development, a project manager plays a crucial role in ensuring projects stay on track, meet client needs, and achieve organizational objectives.
    CHALLENGES FACED 
    Changing Requirements: Adapting to evolving client needs.
    Resource Constraints: Balancing limited resources.
Technical Complexity: Handling intricate software development processes.
Time Pressure: Meeting deadlines without compromising quality.
Conflict Resolution: Addressing team conflicts or disagreements.
Scope Creep: Preventing uncontrolled expansion of project scope.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
   Software maintenance is the ongoing process of nurturing and enhancing software after it has been deployed. It involves tasks such as fixing bugs, improving performance, adding new features, and adapting the software to changing environments throughout its lifetime.

   software maintenance ensures software longevity, performance, and alignment with evolving needs. 
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
   Some ethical issues software engineersmay face are:Negative Feature-Impact Relationship,Weak Security Protection,Personal Data Collection and Algorithmic Bias

   To adhere to ethical standards , they should Stay informed about ethical guidelines,Stay informed about ethical guidelines,Document decisions and rationale and Prioritize user well-being
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
